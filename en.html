			<h2>About us</h2>
				<p>SpeakHub is a non-governmental organization that aims to provide equal learning opportunities in English speaking to children from different backgrounds in Hong Kong.</p>
				<p>Through fun activities like Guided Reading, Games, Singing, Drama and Roleplay, we hope to equip our students with the skills and confidence to express themselves freely through English.</p>
				<h3>Why speaking?</h3>
				<p>English, as we all know, is the language of opportunity.</p>
				<p>Schools in Hong Kong have taught English as a mandatory subject for decades, yet many students in Hong Kong still struggle with conversing and expressing their ideas in English.</p>
				<p>When compared with students educated overseas or in Hong Kong international schools, students from local schools are often weaker in oral English and are less likely to speak up.</p>
				<p>A lack of confidence and skill in spoken English would have a great limiting effect on opportunities in tertiary education, career paths, and global mobility in young lives.</p>
				<p>By building up their spoken English abilities, we hope to enable Hong Kongâ€™s youth to fulfill their dreams and reach their full potential.</p>
				<h3>Why SpeakHub?</h3>
				<p>While Hong Kong students have rigorous curriculums on reading and writing English in schools, opportunities to use English in studentsâ€™ daily lives are few and far between.</p>
				<p>SpeakHub is founded on the belief that learning spoken English is built on authentic language experiences.</p>
				<p>By immersing students in an all-English environment that emphasizes organic interactions, we hope to equip them with an arsenal of colloquial vocabulary and mastery of the natural flow of the language.</p>
				<p>Lessons will be packed with activities such as dramaðŸŽ­, singingðŸŽ¤, games ðŸŽ²and craftsðŸŽ¨, so fun times are abound for both students and teachers!</p>
				<h3>Who&#39;s behind SpeakHub?</h3>
				<p>SpeakHub is founded by Shannen Li with the help of Vanessa Yau.</p>
				<p>Shannen is the brain behind SpeakHub. She grew up in New Zealand and has over 10 years of teaching experience, including private tutoring of more than 30 students in English and voluntary teaching in multiple local schools. She is a Psychology graduate from CUHK and studied IB in Shatin College.</p>
				<p>Vanessa has over 3 years of experience in designing brand strategies and refining operation flows for a wide range of companies in different industries, and has spent time voluntary teaching in both Hong Kong and China. She is a BBA(Law) graduate from HKU and Diocesan Girlsâ€™ School.</p>
